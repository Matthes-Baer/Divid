# Divid

This project served the purpose of learning to work with the React Native framework for mobile apps. This app is not deployed in a store for public access.
It includes a small game and backend features like Firebase authentication and a connection to a real-time Firebase database.
While doing well in the game rounds, the user is rewarded with points, which can be spent to purchase new profile pictures from a picture rewards shop in the app.
